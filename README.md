# Denis Sud

Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Models

## About Me

I'm a student at MSU with a passion for artificial intelligence that began at age 15. Having spent years studying machine learning and AI through both self-directed learning and formal education (including Stanford CS229, CS230 and Harvard CS50 AI), my research focuses on advanced deep learning techniques, particularly in language modeling and reinforcement learning. I combine theoretical understanding with practical implementation to develop scalable AI solutions.

# Denis Sud

Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Deep Learning and Large Language Models

## About Me

I'm a student at **MSU**. My passion for artificial intelligence began at age 15. Having spent years studying ML/AI through both self-directed learning and formal education (including Stanford CS229, CS230, CS25 and Harvard CS50 AI), my research focuses on advanced deep learning techniques, particularly in language modeling.

## Education
**Moscow State University (MSU)**  
*Bachlors degree, Faculty of Physics*

**Additional Education**  
- **Stanford University (online):**  
  - [CS229: Machine Learning](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) - Fundamental algorithms (SVM, PCA, HMM) and implementation  
  - [CS230: Deep Learning](https://cs230.stanford.edu/) - CNN/RNN/GAN architectures and hyperparameter optimization  
  - [CS25: Transformers Architecture](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs25/) - Attention mechanisms and hardware adaptation  
- **Harvard University (online):**  
  - [CS50: Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) - Algorithms and data structures  
  - [CS50AI: AI with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python) - Problem solving, optimization, knowledge representation  

## Technical Expertise

### My Core Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning libraires**: Jax (with flax nnx and pallas), (**new**) CuTile (for custom kernels), PyTorch, Transformers, Unsloth (for fast PEFT on local hardware)
- **ML Infrastructure**: Distributed training, optimization, deployment, MLOps

### Languages
- Python (Primary): ML and Data Science
- Go: High-performance backend systems
- Rust: Embedded systems & performance-critical components

### Specialized Skills
- **Low-Level Optimization**: SIMD (AVX2/NEON), lock-free allocators, bit-packing  
- **Embedded Systems**: RTOS (FreeRTOS), sensor fusion, device drivers, energy-efficient computing  
- **ML Efficiency**: Model quantization (GGUF/NF4), distillation, mixed precision
